## Introduction

How tall will my child be? This is a common question asked by parents. Predicting a child's adult height is not 100 percent accurate. Below is a popular formula provided by the Mayo clinic, here the child's height is dependent on the mother's and father's hieght.

1. Add the mother's height and the father's height in inches.
2. Add 5 inches for boys or subtract 5 inches for girls.
3. Divide by two.

Most children will reach 4 inches of this estimation.

## Find your childs height

We provide 3 input fields.

1. A radio button to pick the child's gender, with options Male and Female. The default is set to Male.
2. A slider to input the father's height with a range of 36 to 100 inches.
3. A slider to input the mother's height with a range of 36 to 100 inches.

The calcuation is done by adding the mother's and father's height in inches, and then subtracting the child's height by 5 if female and adding by 5 if male.

childHeight = (Dads height + Moms heightt +/- 5) /2
                
Average U.S male height is 69.5 and female height is 64 inches.

# Average Height of US population by gender
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```
```{r}
gender <- c("Male", "Female"); height <- c(69.5, 64);df <- data.frame(gender, height)
ggplot(aes(gender, height), data=df) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.2,aes(fill=gender)) 
```
